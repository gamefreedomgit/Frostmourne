# Game Freedom: Frostmourne Wrath of the Lich King

This BugTracker is a tool to report any issues, errors, bugs and broken mechanics from the Frostmourne (WotLK) realm. With your reports and our skills,
we are going to keep Herod being the highest quality Wrath realm in the world.

# Report Template
When creating a bug report, be sure to name it accordingly ("[MAGE] Blink doesn't work" instead of "mage skill bugged"). Please follow the following template while creating a report:

**Description:**

Describe the bug you have encountered. Why do you think it's a bug? 
Enclose links to things related to the bug using for example http://wowhead.com/

**How to reproduce:**

Please explain what you did when you encountered the bug. What is your class, where were you when it occured. What can we do to reproduce the bug ourselves?

**How it should work:**

Please explain how should it work. Describe the expected behavior and back it with evidence, such as YouTube video / screenshot / comments from relevant date (when Wrath was live on retail).

# When are you going to fix it?

We don't always fix bugs chronologically. Some bugs take more time to fix, while others take even as short as 2 minutes. Bugs are very often fixed based on severity, if there's a gamebreaking issue, we will make sure to fix it first.
